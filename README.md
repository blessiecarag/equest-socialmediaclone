To try the social media clone:

1. Download the zip file containing the project files.
2. Go to your mysql server (Wamp,Xampp,etc.) and create a database named "equest"
3. Click the database and then click import.
4. Upload the equest.sql file from the project folder
5. After importing, type "localhost/equest" on your browser.

Thank you!
